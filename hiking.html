        <h1>Hiking</h1>
        <p>Throghout the Kenai Peninsula there are numerous hikes to go on that vary in difficulty. However, all are extremely beautiful.
          It is highly recommended that you participate in hiking during your stay to get the full experience and beauty that alaska has to offer.
          Please be careful on your hikes and don't forget to pack water, bear spray, and a gun. A few hikes that I would personally recommend would be
          the Skyline hike off of the highway around Cooper Landing, Cooper Lake, and Deception Pass.
        </p>
        <p>The Johnson Pass, Resurrection Pass, and Russian Lakes-to-Resurrection River trails of the Kenai Peninsula make up Alaska's most developed trail system. Turn of-the-century prospectors blazed these trails and carried millions of dollars of gold over them. The well-worn footpaths climb through forested valleys to open meadows shimmering with wildflowers and gem-colored lakes. Bridges make it one of Alaska's few regions where you can keep your socks dry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest draw for users in the summer is certainly the Russian River Falls and fish counting station, both of which are good bets for salmon viewing, and lie just 2.4 miles from the lower trailhead. At the falls, you can walk out on decks that are partially suspended over the water, which makes for great photo ops photos of airborne fish.
          The first few miles of trail from the Russian River Campground into the lake are wide with a gravel base, which makes them suitable for biking and those with disabilities. A couple of nice campsites sit opposite the fish counting site at the outflow of Russian Lake, but if you choose to camp here you should be especially vigilant about bear safety, because the bruins come from miles around to feed and there is likely at least one nearby.

Continue on around Russian Lake on a narrower trail that will bring you to a forest service cabin at the far end of the lake, situated on a small, peaceful point with tall spruce trees around it. From the cabin, continue on into the mountains on a circuit that eventually brings you to Cooper Lake and the northern terminus of the trail. In the fall, this area hosts quite a few hunting parties with pack animals, so be aware of the possibility for added traffic and offer the right-of-way,
especially if youâ€™re biking. </p>
